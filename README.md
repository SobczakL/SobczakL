 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 <p>In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I began to learn Python as a way to pass the time. To my surprise, I quickly fell in love with programming and decided to explore its possibilities further. Starting with games and websites, I enjoyed the hands-on experience of interacting with what I created. This ignited my self-study journey, where I delved into using Python to interact with my operating system and begun Harvard's open-source CS101 course.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>
 Initially, I never considered programming as a potential career due to my misconceptions about the need for extensive mathematical skills. However, after dedicating about a year to small projects, I decided to change gears and take my learning more seriously. Leaving my self-doubts behind, I committed to a daily routine of coding, reading, utilizing online resources, and following tutorials to expand my knowledge. 
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
 Balancing my career and studying schedule proved challenging, but I sought additional support by enrolling in a boot camp. This experience provided the boost I needed to overcome the plateau I was facing and boosted my confidence in adopting new technologies. I am proud of the decision I made to embark on this new career journey. It has not only allowed me to grow my technical skills but also introduced me to a welcoming community where I feel a strong sense of belonging and pride.
 </p>
 <br/>

 <p>
 Every day, I strive to push myself further, programming has become an integral part of my life and has positively impacted my overall wellbeing. Throughout my learning, I have noticed a change in my own thinking process adopted through my studies: I have further nurtured my curiosity, strengthened my problem solving skills, and brought light to a tenacity to one day be a leader in the space. I look forward to what lays ahead in this lifelong journey.
