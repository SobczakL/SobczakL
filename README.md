 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 <p>In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I began learning Python to pass the time. To my surprise, I quickly fell in love with programming and decided to explore its possibilities further. Starting with games and websites, I enjoyed the hands-on experience of bringing my creations to life. This ignited my self-study journey, where I delved into using Python to interact with my operating system and began Harvard's open-source CS101 course.</p>
<br/>
<p>
Initially, I never considered programming as a potential career due to misconceptions about the need for extensive mathematical skills. However, after dedicating about a year to small projects, I decided to take my learning more seriously. Overcoming my self-doubts, I committed to a daily routine of coding, reading, utilizing online resources, and following tutorials to expand my knowledge.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Balancing my career and study schedule proved challenging, so I sought additional support by enrolling in a boot camp. This experience provided the boost I needed to overcome the plateau I was facing and increased my confidence in adopting new technologies. I am proud of the decision I made to embark on this new career journey. It has not only allowed me to grow my technical skills but also introduced me to a welcoming community where I feel a strong sense of belonging and pride.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Every day, I strive to push myself further. Programming has become an integral part of my life and has positively impacted my overall well-being. Throughout my learning journey, I have noticed significant changes in my thinking process: I have nurtured my curiosity, strengthened my problem-solving skills, and developed a tenacity that drives me to one day become a leader in the field. I look forward to what lies ahead in this lifelong journey.
