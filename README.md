 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Programming Journey </h3></summary>
 <p>The quiet of the 2020 pandemic was when I first discovered Python. It started as a way to fill time, but I was quickly captivated by the power of programming. Building my first games and websites, I felt the unique satisfaction of creation, which set me on a path of self-directed learning, including exploring Python's OS capabilities and Harvard's CS101.</p>
 <br/>
 <p>
For a while, I didn't consider programming a viable career, mistakenly believing it required an advanced math background. But after a year of dedicated personal projects, the pull was too strong. I decided to overcome my hesitations, committing to a disciplined daily practice of coding, studying, and absorbing knowledge from every available resource.
</p>
 <br/>
 <p>
Balancing my existing career with this intense learning curve was a challenge, prompting me to join a bootcamp for focused growth. That immersive experience was pivotal, helping me overcome hurdles and build the confidence to embrace new technologies rapidly. I'm immensely proud of taking that leap; it's led to profound skill development and a wonderful sense of belonging within the tech community.
</p>
 <br/>
 <p>
This journey continues to transform me. Programming isn't just what I do; it's influenced how I think – fostering greater curiosity, sharper problem-solving, and a resilient spirit. My goal is to keep growing, learning, and eventually contribute as a leader. I eagerly anticipate the future chapters of this ongoing exploration.
